Some experiments using the Raphael.js library.
All of these experiments are simply me following a Raphael tutorial,
which will be updated here at end of day - I PROMISE.

And it's really me, coding along and learning more about the library.
As I get deeper into it, the experiments will change, and the JS files 
will get cleaner - I PROMISE.
